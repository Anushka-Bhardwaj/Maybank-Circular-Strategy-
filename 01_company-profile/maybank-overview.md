However, **Maybank Singapore’s circular economy efforts remain limited and underreported**, especially compared to regional leaders like DBS and OCBC. This presents an opportunity to design a tailored strategy that enhances circularity in its portfolio and operations.

## 🔍 Why Maybank for This Project?
- **Limited circularity disclosures**: Few public metrics on waste, resource efficiency, or regenerative finance
- **Regional relevance**: Operates in Singapore, a hub for sustainable finance innovation
- **Strategic potential**: Could benefit from a thematic investment framework that integrates circular economy principles

This project aims to evaluate Maybank Singapore’s current sustainability positioning and propose a circular finance strategy that aligns with global ESG trends and local impact goals.
